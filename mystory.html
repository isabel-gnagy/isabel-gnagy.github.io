                    My journey into the growing world of technology started at a very young age. My father and I often recall a moment 
                    when I was around 4 years old as my first steps toward my computer science future. My father's friend worked in an 
                    office that required the computer systems to be switched and updated about every 5 years. Instead of throwing out 
                    the computers, my father insisted on taking in the computers and refurbishing them. I was a curious 4-year-old and 
                    decided to hop on my father's workbench and prod him with questions. When I was around 10 years old I was actively 
                    helping my dad in the whole refurbishing process. I even made a few Christmas ornaments out of old computer parts 
                    that still hang on our tree to this day.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3em;">
                    Fast forward a few years later and I was always the friend in school that you would bring your phone or computer 
                    to when you had troubles. For most of the items I could fix the problem other times it was a user error. During 
                    high school, I was pursuing the route of becoming a biology professor or entering into genetic research. However, 
                    after looking at the curriculum for similar majors, I decided to switch to computer science two weeks before class 
                    started. To learn more about my education click

                    I am passionate about continuing my work as a developer/ software engineer and I hope to never stop learning.
