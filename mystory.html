                    My journey into the growing world of technology started at a very young age. My father and I often
                    recall a momment when I was aorund 4 years old as my first steps towards my computer science future.
                    My father's friend worked in an office the required the computer systems to be switched and updated 
                    about every 5 years. Instead of throwing out the computers my father insisted on taking in the computures
                    and refubishing them. I was a curious 4 year old and decied to hope on my father's work bench and prod him
                    with questions. When I was around 10 years old I was actively helping my dad in the whole refurbishing process.
                    I even made a few christmas orniments out of old computer parts that still hang on our tree to this day.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 3em;">
                    Fast foward a few years later and I was always the friend in school that you would bring your phone
                    or computer to when you had troubles. Most of the item I could fix the problem otehr times it was user error.
                    During high school I was pursiing the route of becoming a biology professor or entering into genetic research.
                    However, after looking at the corriculum for the similar majors, I decied to swtich to computer science two weeks
                    before class started. To learn more about my education click <a href="edu.html" style="color: #545454; text-decoration: none;">here</a>.
                    I am passinoate about continuing my work as a developer/ software engineer and I hope to to never stop learning.
