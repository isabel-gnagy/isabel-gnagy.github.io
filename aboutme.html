              I'm a certified Advanced SCUBA Diver. My favorite dive has been
              off the coast of Oahu, Hawai'i when I went free diving with
              Galapagos and Tiger sharks (no cage). I also went diving through
              the lava tubes along the Northern sea shore. I am pictured above at
              my first wreck dive on the Kittiwake in Grand Cayman. My
              deepest dive was on the Thunderbolt shipwreck in the Florida Keys
              at 120ft. I hope to continue diving throughout my whole life as my
              grandfather and father have.

              Since I was a child I have often traveled with my family and
              friends. I have been to 5 countries: Ireland, Scotland, Wales,
              England, and Canada. I have been to nearly half of the states in
              the USA. I often visit my second home in the Florida Keys and I
              hope to retire there one day. I plan to visit all of the US 
              National Parks in my life time. So far I've made it to 17/63 parks!

            <p>
              I very often like to go on adventures with friends or on my own.
              While I love anything aquatic I try to have fun above sea level.
              One of my favorite forms of adventure is going on a hike. I 
              recently hiked the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim in one day. It took me 
              15 hours to complete the 24.5 mile hike! The picture above is 
              me at the very start of my hike. My hope is to eventually retire 
              early and travel for the remainder of my life like my 
              granparents did.

            <p>
              Mental and physical health are equally important and I
              take steps to make both better consistently. I especially love
              taking moments to myself or communicating with loved ones for
              peace of mind. My dog keeps me on my feet constantly and I love
              her dearly for it. With the recent return to office, I've found 
              making time for the gym harder so I've been making it a mission 
              to stay active with the time and resources I have.

            <h3>Reading Ready</h3>
          </center>
          <div>
            <p>
              I enjoy my quiet reading time when I'm not working on side
              projects. Barnes and Noble trips are always fun but I truly enjoy
              finding local quaint book stores. Sci-fi/ fantasy, technology 
              related fiction and murder mysteries are my favorite reads. I love new book
              recommendations and trading books with friends. I have recently
              joined a book club with my mother at our local library.

            <h3>Natural Nerd</h3>
          </center>
          <div>
            <p>
              I would say that I fit the stereotypical idea of a nerd. I enjoy
              gaming and I especially love any Legend of Zelda or Mario game. I
              have other nerdy joys like DND (both playing and watching, I'm
              partial to Critical Role). I recently achieved a life long dream 
              of building my own desktop PC. I also often research tech specs on 
              random things like laptops, cameras, phone accessories, and more.

              I am most certainly an introvert, except when it comes to my
              friends. I love visiting with them, it gives me a little boost of
              happiness. We often make evening plans to play games, watch
              movies, go to bars and restaurants or go see a concert or show. 
              Lot of my friends from college are out of state but we love to 
              meet for concerts, as many a year as time and our wallets will allow
