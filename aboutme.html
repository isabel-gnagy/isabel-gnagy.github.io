          <h1><i>Starting Out Young</i></h1>
          <p>
            My journey into the growing world of technology started at a very
            young age. My father and I often recall a moment when I was around 4
            years old as my first steps toward my computer science future. My
            father's friend worked in an office that required the computer
            systems to be switched and updated about every 5 years. Instead of
            throwing out the computers, my father insisted on taking in the
            computers and refurbishing them. I was a curious 4-year-old and
            decided to hop on my father's workbench and prod him with questions.
            When I was around 10 years old I was actively helping my dad in the
            whole refurbishing process. I even made a few Christmas ornaments
            out of old computer parts that still hang on our tree to this day.

          <h1><i>They Grow Up So Quickly</i></h1>
          <p>
            Fast forward a few years later and I was always the friend in school
            that you would bring your phone or computer to when you had
            troubles. For most of the items I could fix the problem; other times
            it was a user error. During high school, I was pursuing the route of
            becoming a biology professor or entering into genetic research.
            However, after looking at the curriculum for similar majors, I
            decided to switch to computer science two weeks before class
            started. To learn more about my education click

              >here</a
            >. I am passionate about continuing my work as a developer/software
            engineer and I hope to never stop learning.

              I have taken pride in my health and I want to be the strongest I
              can be. Mental and physical health are equally important and I
              take steps to make both better consistently. I especially love
              taking moments to myself or communicating with loved ones for
              peace of mind. I am an avid gym-goer and set monthly goals for
              myself to keep my motivation high.

              I enjoy my quiet reading time when I'm not working on side
              projects. Barnes and Noble trips are always fun but I truly enjoy
              finding local quaint book stores. Sci-fi/fantasy or biographies of
              favorite celebrities are my favorite reads. I love new book
              recommendations and trading books with friends. I have recently
              joined a book club with my mother at our local library.

              I would say that I fit the stereotypical idea of a nerd. I enjoy
              gaming and I especially love any Legend of Zelda or Mario game. I
              have other nerdy joys like DND (both playing and watching, I'm
              partial to Critical Role). I hope to start building my first solo
              desktop PC. I often research tech specs on random things like
              laptops, cameras, phone accessories, and more.

              I am most certainly an introvert, except when it comes to my
              friends. I love visiting with them, it gives me a little boost of
              happiness. We often make evening plans to play games, watch
              movies, go to bars and restaurants or go see a concert or show.
              This year alone we've been to four concerts together and I can't
              wait for more. I hope to start traveling with friends soon.

              I'm a certified Advanced SCUBA Diver. My favorite dive has been
              off the coast of Oahu, Hawai'i when I went free diving with
              Galapagos and Tiger sharks (no cage). I also went diving through
              the lava tubes along the Northern sea shore. The picture to the
              left was my first wreck dive on the Kittiwake in Grand Cayman. My
              deepest dive was on the Thunderbolt shipwreck in the Florida Keys
              at 120ft. I hope to continue diving throughout my whole life as my
              grandfather and father have.

              Since I was a child I have often traveled with my family and
              friends. I have been to 5 countries: Ireland, Scotland, Wales,
              England, and Canada. I have been to nearly half of the states in
              the USA. I often visit my second home in the Florida Keys and I
              hope to retire there one day. Until then, as I work remotely, I
              hope to move around the country and possibly travel to other
              countries for work.

              I very often like to go on adventures with friends or on my own.
              While I love anything aquatic I try to have fun above sea level.
              One of my favorite forms of adventure is going on a hike. I love
              discovering new unique actives to do like zip-lining or bunjee
              jumping, which is on my bucket list. My hope is to eventually
              retire early and travel for the remainder of my life.
