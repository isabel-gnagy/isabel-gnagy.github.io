        <h1>MY MISSION</h1>
        <p>
          As a junior in the field of Information Technology, I strive to be
          where I can utilize my skills to expand my career journey further
          while contributing to the growth of the organization.
        </p>
        <h1>MY STORY</h1>
        <p>
          My journey into the growing world of technology started at a very
          young age. My father and I often recall a moment when I was around 4
          years old as my first steps toward my computer science future. My
          father's friend worked in an office that required the computer systems
          to be switched and updated about every 5 years. Instead of throwing
          out the computers, my father insisted on taking in the computers and
          refurbishing them. I was a curious 4-year-old and decided to hop on my
          father's workbench and prod him with questions. When I was around 10
          years old I was actively helping my dad in the whole refurbishing
          process. I even made a few Christmas ornaments out of old computer
          parts that still hang on our tree to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a few years later and I was always the friend in school
          that you would bring your phone or computer to when you had troubles.
          For most of the items I could fix the problem; other times it was a
          user error. During high school, I was pursuing the route of becoming a
          biology professor or entering into genetic research. However, after
          looking at the curriculum for similar majors, I decided to switch to
          computer science two weeks before class started. I am passionate about
          continuing my work as a developer/software engineer and I hope to
          never stop learning.
