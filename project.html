              I am continuing to brainstorm mini-project ideas. I've had many
              come to mind but none so far have taken root in my brain. Finding
              time to dedicate is also an obstacle I face as a growing adult.

              After completing my "Personal & Professional Website" project, I
              realized that it had major flaws. I came to understand that I
              created a website tailored to my computer. Its styles and format
              did not keep on multi-media such as tablets or mobile views. I did
              not want to alter the website so I could use it as a showcase for
              my growth. Instead, I started from scratch and built this new site
              with many improvements. I believe that this is a website that I
              can use for an online portfolio. I hope that I have set up this
              website with the ability to adapt and add to it.

              In the technology industry, we are starting to become remote and
              isolated from others. But I don't want to lose the personal
              connections and ability to learn about my peers. I decided to make
              a website for myself to bridge this gap with information on me
              professionally and personally for those around me to view. I also
              enjoyed the challenge of designing HTML for personal experience.

              Both of these projects were related to my Senior Project classes.
              Two classes were taught in unison, a software development and
              software-focused writing course. The project for our development
              class was created for the students in the education department to
              help prepare for their submission of the edTPA (Education Teacher
              Performance Assessment). For the Writing course we had to pick a
              topic of interest for a blog and make several posts and answer any
              questions from commenters.
