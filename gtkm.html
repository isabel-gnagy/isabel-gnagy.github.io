        <h2>Gym Rat</h2>
        <p>
          I have taken pride in my health and I want to be the strongest I can
          be. Mental and physical health are equally important and I take steps
          to make both better consistently. I especially love taking moments to
          myself or communicating with loved ones for peace of mind. I am an
          avid gym-goer and set monthly goals for myself to keep my motivation
          high.

          <h2>Book Worm</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy my quiet reading time when I'm not working on side projects.
            Barnes and Noble trips are always fun but I truly enjoy finding
            local quaint book stores. Sci-fi/fantasy or biographies of favorite
            celebrities are my favorite reads. I love new book recommendations
            and trading books with friends. I have recently joined a book club
            with my mother at our local library.

          <h2>Diver Down</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a certified Advanced SCUBA Diver. My favorite dive has been off
            the coast of Oahu, Hawai'i when I went free diving with Galapagos
            and Tiger sharks (no cage). I also went diving through the lava
            tubes along the Northern sea shore. The picture to the left was my
            first wreck dive on the Kittiwake in Grand Cayman. My deepest dive
            was on the Thunderbolt shipwreck in the Florida Keys at 120ft. I
            hope to continue diving throughout my whole life as my grandfather
            and father have.

          <h2>Wandering Woman</h2>
          <p>
            Since I was a child I have often traveled with my family and
            friends. I have been to 5 countries: Ireland, Scotland, Wales,
            England, and Canada. I have been to nearly half of the states in the
            USA. I often visit my second home in the Florida Keys and I hope to
            retire there one day. Until then, as I work remotely, I hope to move
            around the country and possibly travel to other countries for work.

          <h2>Audacious Adventurer</h2>
          <p>
            I very often like to go on adventures with friends or on my own.
            While I love anything aquatic I try to have fun above sea level. One
            of my favorite forms of adventure is going on a hike. I love
            discovering new unique actives to do like zip-lining or bunjee
            jumping, which is on my bucket list. My hope is to eventually retire
            early and travel for the remainder of my life.
