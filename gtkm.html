            I have taken pride in my health and I want to be the strongest I can
            be. Mental and physical health are equally important and I take
            steps to make both better consistently. I especially love taking
            moments to myself or communicating with loved ones for peace of
            mind. I am an avid gym-goer and set monthly goals for myself to keep
            my motivation high.

            I enjoy my quiet reading time when I'm not working on side projects.
            Barnes and Noble trips are always fun but I truly enjoy finding
            local quaint book stores. Sci-fi/fantasy or biographies of favorite
            celebrities are my favorite reads. I love new book recommendations
            and trading books with friends. I have recently joined a book club
            with my mother at our local library.

            I would say that I fit the stereotypical idea of a nerd. I enjoy
            gaming and I especially love any Legend of Zelda or Mario game. I
            have other nerdy joys like DND (both playing and watching, I'm
            partial to Critical Role). I hope to start building my first solo
            desktop PC. I often research tech specs on random things like
            laptops, cameras, phone accessories, and more.

            I am most certainly an introvert, except when it comes to my
            friends. I love visiting with them, it gives me a little boost of
            happiness. We often make evening plans to play games, watch movies,
            go to bars and restaurants or go see a concert or show. This year
            alone we've been to four concerts together and I can't wait for
            more. I hope to start traveling with friends soon.

            I'm a certified Advanced SCUBA Diver. My favorite dive has been off
            the coast of Oahu, Hawai'i when I went free diving with Galapagos
            and Tiger sharks (no cage). I also went diving through the lava
            tubes along the Northern sea shore. The picture to the left was my
            first wreck dive on the Kittiwake in Grand Cayman. My deepest dive
            was on the Thunderbolt shipwreck in the Florida Keys at 120ft. I
            hope to continue diving throughout my whole life as my grandfather
            and father have.

            Since I was a child I have often traveled with my family and
            friends. I have been to 5 countries: Ireland, Scotland, Wales,
            England, and Canada. I have been to nearly half of the states in the
            USA. I often visit my second home in the Florida Keys and I hope to
            retire there one day. Until then, as I work remotely, I hope to move
            around the country and possibly travel to other countries for work.

            I very often like to go on adventures with friends or on my own.
            While I love anything aquatic I try to have fun above sea level. One
            of my favorite forms of adventure is going on a hike. I love
            discovering new unique actives to do like zip-lining or bunjee
            jumping, which is on my bucket list. My hope is to eventually retire
            early and travel for the remainder of my life.
